Dear Jane,

Thanks for reaching out and we appreciate your time and effort to apply with CodePath. 

At the moment, courses are currently offered to students enrolled within partner universities in the United States. 

We understand that eligibility requirements can be a difficulty for students residing on a different country and CodePath is trying it's best to find a way for students from all around the globe to access quality tech education. 

We have provided two sections of eligibilty checks for students on the  front page of application form and we encourage everyone to read the terms and conditions to fully understand the requirements needed for the admission. 

CodePath is currently running classes with Haiti and used to run with Taiwan. We really look forward opening classes in Asia and see you soon but currently we are restricted with our sponsorships in the United States. 

If you wish to, you can subscribe to our [mailing list](https://google.com), we'll notify you as soon as new classes becomes available within your area. 

In the meantime, there are other resources available with [CodePath](https://support.codepath.com) that may help you boost your coding skills.

We wish you the best and hope to see you soon with CodePath. 


All the best,

Nicole Panlilio
