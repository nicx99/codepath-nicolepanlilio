Hi Anne,

Thank you for your interest with the Summer Internship Program at CodePath. 

We regret to inform you that the registration has already closed and the program is bound to start by Monday, October 9, 2023. 

The internship program is only open for 200 students for this summer. Due to the increasing demand, the registration was filled up within 3 days of opening. 

We understand that this might be your graduating year and we would like to extend our help as much as we could to help you land your internship with other companies. 

Please check this [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) from CodePath that may help you wih your interviews. 

You can also subscribe to our [Mailing list](https://codepath.org) for any internship openings and resource guides available. 

We wish for your success. 

All the best,

Nicole P.
