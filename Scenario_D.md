Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out with CodePath Support.

Our records indicate that you have missed a coursework under your curriculum. 

We value our courseworks to make sure that students are able to apply all the learnings within the sessions provided in the course. CodePath policy states that missing **(1) coursework submission** will result to removal from our classes. We also had several attempts to contact you via slack and email to make sure everything is fine on your end but we didn't get a response. 

Although you have been removed from the class, you still have a lifetime access with the course material provided that you will use the github you used to sign up with CodePath. 

Let us know your thoughts and we hope we can still help you with your coding journey. 

Best,

Nicole P.
